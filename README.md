## Steps Completed
1. Explored GitHub Marketplace Models and tested a model in the Playground.
2. Created a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT).
3. Set up a Google Colab notebook.
4. Made the first successful model call.
5. Built a Text Summarizer mini project.
6. Saved the generated output and uploaded files to GitHub.

## Reflection
This lab helped me understand how to use GitHub Marketplace Models and integrate them into a real Python application using Google Colab. I learned how to securely use API tokens, make AI model calls, and generate summarized outputs. It also improved my understanding of prompt design and model interaction.
